<h3>Final Project</h3><br>
<p> I wanted to make something to help me get around harvard yard with my terrible scene of direction. I decided to make something that would tell me which cardinal direction I was heading in, and possibly attach to my clothing. This is the digial compass I ended up making:<p>

<p> In my original plan I also wanted to make a piece of clothing for the compass to attach to. I wanted to use LEDs to indicate which direction I was traveling in.<p>

 <br>

<p> To set about creating this, I first had to find a magnetic sensor which could tell me which way is north. I used a type of magnetometer called a hall effect sensor. Here is an intial test I conducted where I got a red LED to turn on when the hall effect sensor was pointing north and a white LED to turn on when it was pointing south.<p>

<p>I realized that it would be impractical to have to have a person turn around like this to find the direction, so I decided to put the hall effect sensor on a turning motor. I would make the hall effect sensor turn a full rotation, and compare the values it got. Where the hall effect sensor recieved the highest value would be magentic north. I used a special kind of motor with something called an encoder attached to the back. The encoder counts how many times the motor turns. It is important to note that the motor turns almost a thousand time everytime the motorshaft makes one full rotation. I was able to use the encoder data to find the position the hall effect sensor was at when it inputed each signal. I was able to use the combination of the comparison of the hall effect sensor values and the encoder data to make a prototype that stips out a position value for where north is. Here is a video: <p>

<p>I had a problem where 0 position would change based on where I would reset the program. To solve this I used a button to calibrate my encoder. When the button is pressed the position is reset to 0. This way I can have the 0 position in the same place every time.<p>

<p>All the wires started being a mess and getting tangled, so I decided to make a custom PCB (printed circut board). This would also have an added benefit of helping me to miniaturize my project. There is a spot on my PCB to add a soleniod, but I ended up not using that. Here are the skematic and PCB drawings:<p>

<p>Here is a picture of PCB after I soldered sockets into it and added my Esp 32 dev board and some other compenents.<p>

<p>The next step was to create the housing for my digital compass. I went through multiple prototypes. I used screws to attact my PCB to the housing, so I had to make sure all the holes were perfectly alined. I also needed to make a piece to hold the motor and slip ring with the hall effect sensor on top. A slip allows wires to rotate without getting tangled. I decided to put the hall effect sensor on top of a slip ring because it kept getting ripped out by the wires. I used gears to connect the motor and slip ring, so I needed to make sure I had the correct spacing inbetween them in my housing for the gears to fit.<p>
