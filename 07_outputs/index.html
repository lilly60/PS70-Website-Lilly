<h3>Week 7: Electronic Outputs</h3>



<h4>Assignment: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Final Project</h4>
<p>For my MVP I decided to make a prototype of the device which I will use to tell which direction north is. This consisted of a DC motor with an encoder on the back and a hall effect sensor<p>

 <img src=Hall-pic.png width = "300vw"> </img> 
 <img src=motor.png width = "400vw"> </img> 

<p>Hall effect sensors can sense magnetic fields. When a magnet is not close by the hall effect sensor can sense the earth's magnetic field. From lasts week's experimentation I figured out that the hall effect sensor will read its higest value when facing towards magetic north (as long as it's not moved up and down or tilted). To be able to find north I need to have my hall effect sensor rotate 360 degrees.<p><br>

 <img src=wiring.jpeg width = "500vw"> </img> 
  

  <p>To do this I attachted the hall effect sensor to the shaft of a motor with an encoder. The encoder counts roughly 1000 times for every one rotation the motor shaft makes. I can use the count from the encoder to figure out where in the rotation north is. <p><br>

  <p>I used an oscilloscope to measure what my my DC motor was reciving<p>

  <img src=osc.jpeg width = "600vw"> </img> 

  <p>The pulse width modulation happened over a time domain of 2 milliseconds. In the picture my motor recives 5 volts about a third of the time and 0 volts in the other two thirds. This corresponds to the speed I used of 100, which is about 30 percent of 255. (speed when using analogWrite is a number between 0 and 255)<p><br>

<h3.5> Here is the code I used: <h3.5>
  <pre><code class="language-arduino" body style="background-color:pink;">
const int A1A = 9; //These are the two pins that control the motor driver
const int A1B = 10;
const int encOut1 = 2; //These are the encoder output pins
const int encOut2 = 3;
int position = 0;
float hallValue = 0;
float maxHallValue = 0;
int northPos = 0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(encOut1), encoderInterupt, RISING);
  //This uses a special funciton called interupt which allows the ardunio to check if a pin is reciving 
  //charge even if it is running other code in the loop. This means the encoder can count even while
  //other stuff if happening
}

void loop() {
  hallValue = analogRead(A0); //makes hallValue variable equal output from hall sensor

  if (position <=0){ // if the position (defined later) is less than/equals 0 make the motor move
  maxHallValue = 0;
  analogWrite (A1A, 0);
  analogWrite (A1B, 100);
}

  if (position >= 1000) { // makes motor move in opposite direction once position reaches 1000
  analogWrite(A1A, 100);
  analogWrite(A1B, 0);
  }

if (hallValue > maxHallValue){ //compares the current hall value to previous largest value
  maxHallValue = hallValue; // if current value is largest then renames to maxHallValue
  northPos = position; // records position when this happens
  Serial.println("northPos");
  Serial.println(northPos); // prints position value of hall effect sensor facing north
}
}
void encoderInterupt(){ // this is the function called when ever encOut1 pin recives a charge (see attachInterupt above)
  int direction = digitalRead(encOut2); // reads other encoder pin and makes equal direction variable
  if (direction == HIGH){// if both encoder pins receive charge then add 1 to position
    position+=1;
  }
  else{ // if the second encoder pin reads no charge subtract 1 from position
    position-=1;
  }
  
}
  </code></pre>

  <p> Here is a video of my sucessful test <p>

</video>

  <p> Problems to solve for the future: <br> I need a method to make sure that the positiion the encoder counts as 0 is in the same place every time.<br> I also need to make sure that my sensor is actually giving acurate readings. I think this will be much easier once I design a housing for the hall effect sensor and deal with the earlier mentioned calibration issue. <p>
